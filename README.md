# Obsidian Frontmatter Links
A small [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that recognizes links, wikilinks, and markdown links in a note's YAML frontmatter.

## Road Map
The main functionality of the plugin is fully functional for my use-case, so working on the following issues are low-priority for me right now. However, they are planned.

- [ ] https://github.com/Trikzon/obsidian-frontmatter-links/issues/1 Render frontmatter links like Obsidian renders links when cursor is near
- [ ] https://github.com/Trikzon/obsidian-frontmatter-links/issues/2 Add frontmatter links to the Obsidian graph

## Installation
- Currently not released in Obsidian's Community Plugins repository.
- Use the [Brat](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin.
